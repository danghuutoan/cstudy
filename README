Files for "Intermediate C Programming"

The top-level directory (the one containing this README file)
contains the source files for the first (week 1) version of the
game.  The week# directories contain additional code we'll be
adding in the weeks to come.

You can either grab the files one at a time, or download the
single file game.tar.Z, which is a compressed archive of all of
them.  If you grab this file, remember to use ftp "binary" mode.
After retrieving it, you can uncompress it and extract the
archive contents with the commands

	uncompress game.tar.Z
	tar xvf game.tar

(These invocations assume you're on a Unix system, although
versions of the commands exist for other operating systems as
well.  If you don't have the uncompress command, try using gunzip.)
